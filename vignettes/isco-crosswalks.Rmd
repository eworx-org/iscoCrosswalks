# Introduction

Eurostat, CEDEFOP, and other EU agencies have been looking into using the ISCO classification to
link job–worker characteristics like skill importance and level ratings to European jobs. O*NET is a
reliable source of occupational data for the European labour market because of its strong theoretical
and empirical basis and the similarities between the European and US economic systems.
Drawing on O\*NET necessitates mapping from one classification to another since the O\*NET
database classifies jobs differently than the EU. This is accomplished via a “concordance” (also known
as a “crosswalk” or “correspondence table”). We propose the a publicly accessible software for
methodologically transparent concordances, by constructing an R-package that we hope will greatly
reduce the expenses and time required to perform an approximate mapping between the two
categorization systems.

Understanding the variations in how jobs are organized in the US and the EU is necessary to realize
the necessity for a more granular concordance. While the SOC and the ISCO have similar goals, there
are significant distinctions in the organization and information included in occupational profiles. The
US SOC has 867 6-digit classifications for statistics reporting (e.g., number of people employed or
average wage). The EU ISCO, on the other hand, employs the ISCO 4-digit categorization, which has
436 unit groups, and adds an extra layer of information of approximately 3000 occupational
distinctions. Both systems group occupations according to a four-level hierarchy, with ISCO adding
an extra degree of detail.

# Crosswalks

This package introduces an algorithm that conducts approximate matching between the ISCO
and SOC classifications using concordances provided by the Institute for Structural
Research and Faculty of Economics, University of Warsaw. The crosswalks offer a complete
step-by-step mapping of O\*NET data to ISCO88 and ISCO-08 coding using an expanded version
of SOC-00 and SOC-10 coding. We propose a mapping method based on the aforementioned research
that converts measurements to the smallest possible unit of the target taxonomy, and then
performs an aggregation/estimate to the appropriate degree of detail.

> "In case of raw-count data the `sum` by occupation group is used, else for composite
indicators the `mean` value is used by each occupational group of the target hierarchical level."

## Example (ISCO-SOC)

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to translate CEDEFOPs
"Importance of foundation skills" indicator given in ISCO(2008) to SOC(2010)
classification:

intelligence tool](https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/tools/skills-intelligence)

```{r example}
library(iscoCrosswalks)
```

The percentage of jobs where foundation skills (literacy, numeracy, ICT,
and foreign languages) are highly crucial for doing the work is shown in this
indicator. It is based on the findings of Cedefop's European survey of skills
and jobs.

The Skills Foundation Indicator is exposed also in `iscoCrosswalks` as an
example data-set. It consists of three variables

- `Occupations`
- `Skill`
- `Value`

To perform the transformation, we've added a third column with the
`preferredLabel` from the ISCO taxonomy. In the R terminal, type `isco` to
access the desired labels. Manual entry of preferred labels is suggested for
small data. See also the R package
[labourR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=labourR) for automating the
occupations coding, in case of big data-sets.

Inspecting the indicator,

```{r}
kable(foundation_skills[seq(1 , nrow(foundation_skills), by = 5), ])
```

To translate the indicator to SOC classification, `iscoCrosswalks` has two
mandatory column names. Namely, `job` and `value` standing for the preferred
labels of the taxonomy and the value of the indicator respectively. 

Thus, we rename `preferredLabel` to `job`, and `Value` to `value`.

```{r}
data.table::setnames(foundation_skills,
                     c("preferredLabel", "Value"),
                     c("job", "value"))
```

The `isco_soc_crosswalk()` function can translate the values to the desired
taxonomy. The parameter `brkd_cols` accepts a vector that indicates
other columns used for grouping. 

Also, since this is a composite score we set `indicator = TRUE` to use `mean`
value. Instead, if raw counts are given then we set `indicator = FALSE` to
aggregate the units of the hierarchy.

```{r}
soc_foundation_skills <- isco_soc_crosswalk(foundation_skills,
                                            brkd_cols = "Skill",
                                            isco_lvl = 1,
                                            soc_lvl = "soc_1",
                                            indicator = TRUE)
```

In the following table we visualize the top 6 occupations by Skill, of the
projected indicator to the SOC taxonomy.

```{r}
soc_foundation_skills[, Occupations := gsub(" Occupations", "", soc_label)]
soc_foundation_skills[, Skill := gsub(" skills", "", Skill)]
dat <- soc_foundation_skills[order(Skill, -value)][, head(.SD, 6), by = "Skill"]
kable(dat)
```

If the reverse process is required, use the `soc_isco_crosswalk()` function. The
preffered labels of the taxonomy can be inspected in the included dataset 
`soc_groups`.
