Description: Allows the user to perform approximate
 matching between the occupational classifications using concordances provided by
 the Institute for Structural Research and Faculty of Economics, University of
 Warsaw, <doi:10.1111/ecot.12145>. The crosswalks offer a complete
 step-by-step mapping of Standard Occupational Classification (2010) data to the
 International Standard Classification of Occupations (2008). We propose a
 mapping method based on the aforementioned research that converts measurements
 to the smallest possible unit of the target taxonomy, and then performs an
 aggregation/estimate to the requested degree Occupational Hierarchical level.
